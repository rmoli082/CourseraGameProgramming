# Coursera Game Design and Development Specialization
Offered by Michigan State University

This Specialization covers the theoretical and practical foundations of video game production using the Unity 3D game engine. Youâ€™ll learn to develop a game concept; prototype, test, and iterate on your ideas; and navigate licensing, marketing, and other business considerations. The specialization builds a solid foundation for industry roles as a gameplay designer, level designer, technical designer, technical artist, programmer, or producer.

## Introduction to Game Development
### Project 1: Solar System
Using the Unity3D engine, develop a simulation of the solar system. Click on the planets to center the view on the planet. All assets and scripts were provided.

### Project 2: Roller Madness
Using the Unity3D engine, create a brief coin pickup game. Roll a ball around a square platform to try and collect coins. Don't get hit by the cubes! Two levels were created, and all assets and scripts were provided.

### Project 3: Box Shooter
Using the Unity3D engine, create a simple "box shooter" style game. Various targets appear in 3D space around a boxed in character. Acquire enough points to move to the next level before the time runs out! Two levels were created, all assets and scripts were provided.

### Project 4: Super Sparty Bros
Using the Unity engine, create a 2D platformer game. You control "Sparty", as he avoids enemies on his quest to obtain the victory rose in each level. Assets and starter scripts were provided. The course guided you through creation of a sample level. 2 additional levels were created by me with the addition of self-created hazards and pickups, along with the requisite scripting requirements to add the functionality.
